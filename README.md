# Dogs Vs Cats Classification Problem üì∏ üöÄ

The Dogs & Cats classification problem is a foundational project for learning how to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images as either dogs or cats. This project helps understand how to:

- Develop, evaluate, and use CNN models for image classification.
- Build a robust test harness for estimating model performance.
- Experiment with model improvements by tuning parameters.
- Save and load models to make predictions on new data.

## Introduction üí•

In this project, we will explore how to develop a CNN to classify images of dogs and cats.

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Load and prepare images for training purposes.
- Split data for training and validation.
- Apply Data Augmentation techniques.
- Develop a CNN model using Keras, including selecting parameters for better performance.
- Evaluate the model's performance.
- Save and load the model for future predictions.
- Visualize the confusion matrix for a trained model.

## Data Description

The dataset consists of:
- **Training Data:** 25,000 labeled images of dogs and cats.
- **Testing Data:** Test files (`test1.zip`) to predict labels.

### Labels:
- `1 = Dog`
- `0 = Cat`

---

## To Get Started:
1. **Download Dataset:** Obtain the Dogs vs. Cats dataset.
2. **Load Libraries:** Use essential libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values and encode labels if necessary.
4. **Build the Model:** Create a CNN using Keras with appropriate layers and parameters.
5. **Train and Evaluate:** Train the model, validate it, and tune hyperparameters.
6. **Save the Model:** Store the trained model for future predictions.
7. **Visualize Results:** Use Matplotlib to plot training/validation accuracy and loss.
