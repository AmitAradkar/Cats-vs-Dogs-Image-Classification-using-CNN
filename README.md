# Dogs Vs Cats Classification Problem üì∏ üöÄ

The Dogs & Cats classification problem is a foundational project for learning how to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images as either dogs or cats. This project helps understand how to:

- Develop, evaluate, and use CNN models for image classification.
- Build a robust test harness for estimating model performance.
- Experiment with model improvements by tuning parameters.
- Save and load models to make predictions on new data.

## Introduction üí•

In this project, we will explore how to develop a CNN to classify images of dogs and cats.

### Key Learning Objectives:
- Load and prepare images for training purposes.
- Split data for training and validation.
- Apply Data Augmentation techniques.
- Develop a CNN model using Keras, including selecting parameters for better performance.
- Evaluate the model's performance.
- Save and load the model for future predictions.
- Visualize the confusion matrix for a trained model.

## Data Description

The dataset consists of:
- **Training Data:** 25,000 labeled images of dogs and cats.
- **Testing Data:** Test files (`test1.zip`) to predict labels.

### Labels:
- `1 = Dog`
- `0 = Cat`

## To Get Started:
1. **Download Dataset:** Obtain the Dogs vs. Cats dataset.
2. **Load Libraries:** Use essential libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values and encode labels if necessary.
4. **Build the Model:** Create a CNN using Keras with appropriate layers and parameters.
5. **Train and Evaluate:** Train the model, validate it, and tune hyperparameters.
6. **Save the Model:** Store the trained model for future predictions.
7. **Visualize Results:** Use Matplotlib to plot training/validation accuracy and loss.

##  Conclusion
We successfully built a deep neural network model by implementing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify dog and cat images with very high accuracy 74.00 %.

The model was used to predict the classes of the images from the independent test set and results were submitted to test the accuracy of the prediction with fresh data.

The Cat vs Dog Image Classification model demonstrates the successful implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification tasks. By accurately distinguishing between images of cats and dogs, this project showcases the potential of deep learning algorithms in solving real-world problems involving image analysis. Through this project, we aim to inspire further exploration of CNNs and their applications in various domains,
